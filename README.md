# alchemy_1_cwinsor
This is a fork of Alchemy 1.0 from University of Washington (Domingos et. al.). 

Alchemy is a tool to implement and study Markov Logic Networks.  A MLN combines statistical relational learning and probabilistic logic inference, based on the Markov logic representation.  Alchemy originated from University of Washington (Domingos et. al.)

The code is C++. This fork brings that codebase up to date - it fixes compile errors and allows running on Ubuntu 20 with current apt-get versions. Instructions are provided to run on AWS EC2.
