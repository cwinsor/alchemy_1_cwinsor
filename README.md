# alchemy_1_cwinsor
This is a fork of Alchemy 1.0 from University of Washington (Domingos et. al.). Alchemy "is a software package providing a series of algorithms for statistical relational learning and probabilistic logic inference, based on the Markov logic representation."  Alchemy originated from University of Washington (Domingos et. al.)

The problem addressed by this fork is that as of 5/2022 the U. Washington code does not compile.  Tool versions have changed in the ~10 years since the original work. This fork fixes said compile errors to allow running on Ubuntu 20 with current apt-get versions. Instructions are provided to run on AWS EC2.
